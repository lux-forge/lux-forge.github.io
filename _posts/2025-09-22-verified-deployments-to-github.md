   ```

2. **List your key**:  
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
   ```

   Look for the long string after `rsa4096/`‚Äîthat‚Äôs your key ID.

3. **Export your public key**:  
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```
   Copy the entire key

4. **Add it to GitHub**:  
   Go to [GitHub ‚Üí User Icon ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) ‚Üí **New GPG key**
