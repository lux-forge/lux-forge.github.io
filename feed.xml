While trying to come up with a new way of adding a blog in an “easy fashion” I of course made things 10 times harder by trying to learn a new software in github pages. Figuring it can’t be that hard, I forged ahead and looked into making it look sleek. I found a brilliant post that was ~ 5 years old in a blog called the (Slowbro blog)[https://blog.slowb.ro/dark-theme-for-minima-jekyll/]. Knowing I primarily use a windows machine for my own use, I don’t natrually have a Linux machine to work with. So, natrually, I had to come up to speed with the usability of WSL too.</p>

<p>Some 5 hours later, I was almost there. Jekyll was installed on my new Ubuntu 22.04 WSL kernel attached to a VSCode instance to make modifying the files just that bit easier. As a programmer, I am natrually lazy so I wanted to find a way of automating the version control and changelog. Well, here we are with another post. Will it last? Who knows. But I learnt something new and, lets be honest, thats what a homelab is all about.</p>

VLAN 30 was supposed to be locked down—tight, clean, no cross-talk. But something slipped through. I caught it during a routine packet capture, just a flicker of traffic that shouldn’t have been there. At first, I thought it was a misfire in the rule set. Maybe I’d forgotten to apply the block to the right interface. But everything looked clean.</p>

<p>pfSense said the rule matched. The logs agreed. And yet, the traffic flowed.</p>

<p>I dug deeper. Interface bindings, rule order, floating rules. That’s when I found it—the ghost. A floating rule, long forgotten, silently overriding the interface-specific block. It wasn’t malicious. Just… legacy. A leftover from an earlier experiment, now quietly sabotaging the present.</p>

<p>I stripped it out. Rebuilt the rule set. Captured again. Silence. The block held.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just a fix. It was a reminder: pfSense’s rule evaluation isn’t always intuitive. Floating rules can override without warning. And in a multi-VLAN setup, ghosts linger.</p>
