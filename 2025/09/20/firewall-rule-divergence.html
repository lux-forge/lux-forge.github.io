    <p>It started with a shrug. VLAN 30 was supposed to be locked down—tight, clean, no cross-talk. But something slipped through. I caught it during a routine packet capture, just a flicker of traffic that shouldn’t have been there. At first, I thought it was a misfire in the rule set. Maybe I’d forgotten to apply the block to the right interface. But everything looked clean.</p>

<p>pfSense said the rule matched. The logs agreed. And yet, the traffic flowed.</p>

<p>I dug deeper. Interface bindings, rule order, floating rules. That’s when I found it—the ghost. A floating rule, long forgotten, silently overriding the interface-specific block. It wasn’t malicious. Just… legacy. A leftover from an earlier experiment, now quietly sabotaging the present.</p>

<p>I stripped it out. Rebuilt the rule set. Captured again. Silence. The block held.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just a fix. It was a reminder: pfSense’s rule evaluation isn’t always intuitive. Floating rules can override without warning. And in a multi-VLAN setup, ghosts linger.</p>

<p>This incident is logged in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.forge-history</code>, stamped in v1.0.1, and burned into LuxForge’s memory.</p>
